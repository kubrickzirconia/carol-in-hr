[ABAP Service Implementations][3]

[Repository Wiki][2]


This repository details the steps taken to create an SAP Gateway OData service with code based implementation. The OData service will be able to create, read, update, and delete HR employee address data, which is stored in PA0006. Project created and presented as part of the learning and development component of my grad scheme.

#### Project Aims

* To utilise my conceptual and practical understanding of OData APIs.
* To demonstrate business knowledge gained from working with HR mini master data.
* To work with ABAP on a clearly defined technical project.

#### Functional Concept

#### Technical Solution

This repository is dedicated to detailing the steps taken to create and test the OData services, including code based method implementations. I have aimed to detail the process so throroughly that somebody else could replicate the process. The steps taken to create this OData service, and the tests I undertook on the service to ensure it worked as expected, can be found in this repository's [wiki][2].

The [methods][3] folder contains the redefined methods for the CRUD operations. The ABAP code is included, as well as flowcharts detailing the intended workings of the methods.
